# ðŸ“± Send Reminder Feature

## Overview
The Send Reminder feature allows users to send payment reminders to friends who owe them money. When a reminder is sent, the friend receives both an **in-app notification** and a **push notification** that appears in their mobile notification drawer, even when the app is closed.

## How It Works

### 1. **Where to Find Reminder Buttons**

#### **Debt Item Widget** (Individual Transactions)
- **Location**: Friend Detail Screen â†’ Individual debt/transaction cards
- **Visibility**: Only visible to creditors (people who are owed money) when debt status is "Pending"
- **Button**: Orange "Send Reminder" button with notification icon
- **Access**: 
  - Quick button: Appears directly on debt card
  - Options menu: Available in transaction options when you tap on a debt

#### **Friends Screen Tabs**
- **"They Owe" Tab**: Reminder button next to amounts for direct debts
- **"Splits" Tab**: Reminder button next to amounts for group expenses (only when friend owes you)

### 2. **What Happens When You Send a Reminder**

#### **For the Sender (You)**
1. Loading dialog appears: "Sending reminder..."
2. Success/failure message shows in snackbar
3. Reminder is logged in Firestore for tracking

#### **For the Receiver (Your Friend)**
